					Welcome to the help page for <span>Join</span>, your guide to using
					our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of
					what <span>Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
				</p>
				<div class="what-is-join">
					<h2>What is Join?</h2>
					<p>
						<span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
						and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
						development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br />
						<br />
						Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
						method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
						efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of
						kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
						intuitive, visual interface. <br />
						<br />
						It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an
						educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
						usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,
						we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy,
						or other aspects of quality regarding <span>Join</span>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2>How to use it</h2>
				<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span>:</p>
				<div>
					<div class="step">
						<h2 class="number">1.</h2>
						<p>
							<b class="title">Exploring the Board</b> <br />
							When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
							This board represents your project and contains four default
							lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step">
						<h2 class="number">2.</h2>
						<p>
							<b class="title">Creating Contacts</b> <br />

							In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
							projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact",
							and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
							can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
							board.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step">
						<h2 class="number">3.</h2>
						<p>
							<b class="title">Adding Cards</b> <br />

							Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
							Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
							appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
							the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step">
						<h2 class="number">4.</h2>
						<p>
							<b class="title">Moving Cards</b> <br />

							As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
							on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
							another.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step">
						<h2 class="number">5.</h2>
						<p>
							<b class="title">Deleting Cards</b> <br />

							Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
							list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
							the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
							action is irreversible. <br />
							<br />
							Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates
							from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
							state of your project. <br />
							<br />
